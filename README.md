# Parameter-Extraction-for-2nd-Life-Batteries
Included is code that loads, then processes raw cycling data for 8 pouch cells with LMO/graphite chemistry from a retired EV battery pack. The data is processed for the purpose of extracting parameters characterizing an equivalent circuit model. 

Here is where the public data set comes from:
X. Cui, M. A. Khan, G. Pozzato, S. Singh, R. Sharma, and S. Onori, “Taking second-life batteries from exhausted to empowered using experiments, data analysis, and health estimation,” 2024
