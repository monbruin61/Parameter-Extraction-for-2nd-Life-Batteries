# Parameter-Extraction-for-2nd-Life-Batteries
Included is code that loads, then processes raw cycling data for 8 pouch cells with LMO/graphite chemistry from a retired EV battery pack. The data is processed for the purpose of extracting parameters characterizing an equivalent circuit model. <br />
<br />
Upon generating figures for every cell, it can be observed defining a local minimum or maximum for raw data is ambiguous. In the code, I utilize findpeaks(), however, depending from cell to cell, each instance in which findpeaks() is called, the parameters might need to be tuned due wide variability in the HPPC curves between pouch cells. For some extreme cases, I had to hard code in order to ignore any unwanted points findpeaks() identified as a minimum. 

Change cell_id to change pouch cell (e.g. cell_id = 1p1 to cell_id = 2p3). <br />
Change cycle_num to change cycles for the chosen cell. (Reference figure 1 generated by the code to determine how many cycles one cell has).

Here is where the public data set comes from: <br />
